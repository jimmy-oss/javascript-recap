/* The 7 primitive data types

 1.Number: floating point numbers used for decimals. 
   and integers let age = 23;

 2.String: Sequence of characters used for text. 
   let firstName = "jimmy";

 3.Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or 
   false used for taking decisions.
   let fullAge = true;

 4.Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not 
  yet defined('empty value').
  let children;

 5.Null: Also means 'empty value'.

 6.Symbol(ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot 
   be changed [Not Useful For Now].

 7.BigInt: Larger integers than the Number type can 
   hold.
  
   Javascript has dynamic typing: We do not have to 
   manually define the data type of the value stored 
   in a variable.Instead, data types are determined 
   automatically.
